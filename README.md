## Spotify Recommendation System 🎵
This project is a demonstration of a content-based recommendation system for Spotify, developed as part of an RHOMBIX Technologies Machine Learning Internship Task. The system analyzes user preferences and audio features to generate personalized song recommendations.
## 🎯 Introduction
Music recommendation systems help users discover new songs by analyzing their listening history and preferences. With the rise of streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora, these systems have become essential for enhancing user experience.
This project focuses on developing a content-based filtering recommendation system that suggests songs based on their features and similarity to the user’s preferred tracks.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Building a music recommendation system comes with challenges, such as handling large datasets, feature engineering, and optimizing the recommendation process. The project follows these key steps:
✔️ Data collection from Spotify API or a Kaggle dataset
✔️ Data cleaning, preprocessing (normalization, encoding)
✔️ Applying machine learning techniques like clustering, cosine similarity
✔️ Generating song recommendations based on audio attributes

## 📊 Data Sources
The primary dataset is obtained from Kaggle, but integration with the Spotify API is also explored for real-time recommendations.

## 🛠️ Recommender System Design
🔹 Content-Based Filtering
Analyzes audio features (tempo, genre, mood, etc.)
Finds similar songs based on user input
Uses cosine similarity and mean vectors for association

## 🔹 Collaborative Filtering (Future Scope)
Utilizes user interaction data to suggest songs

Requires user rating data (not available in this project)

## ⚙️ Implementation
1️⃣ Clustering Algorithm: Groups songs with similar attributes
2️⃣ Song Lookup System: Identifies correct songs using Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)
3️⃣ Feature Extraction: Retrieves song characteristics
4️⃣ Similarity Calculation: Uses cosine similarity to find the closest matches
5️⃣ Recommendation Generation: Outputs the top N songs based on user input

## ⚡ Key Challenge: Content-based filtering may lead to "more of the same" recommendations. A hybrid approach (combining collaborative filtering) could improve diversity, but is beyond the scope of this project due to data limitations.

## 📌 Technologies Used
✅ Python 🐍
✅ Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
✅ Spotipy (Spotify API)
✅ Clustering & Cosine Similarity
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn for Visualization

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
🔹 Hybrid filtering for better diversity
🔹 Real-time integration with Spotify API
🔹 User-based recommendation using collaborative filtering
